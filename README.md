# Higher or lower

_**Higher or lower. Coded in C**_

> This is currently a console application.

The goal is the following.

1. The computer randomly draws a number between 1 and 100.
2. He asks you to guess the number. So you enter a number between 1 and 100.
3. The computer compares the number you entered with the “mystery” number it drew. It tells you if the
mystery number is higher or lower than the one you entered.
4. Then the computer asks you for the number again.
5. …And it tells you if the mystery number is higher or lower.
6. And so on, until you find the mystery number.

The object of the game, of course, is to find the mystery number in as few moves as possible.
